- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @CrowboroughChris
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a retired electronics then software developer who worked mainly with Microsoft languages at all levels, most recently VB.Net and T-SQL.
Since retiring I've developed a web site for a local bowls club from scratch in self-taught php and MySql. I've then started developing Android apps using kotlin and MySql for my own use just to keep my brain going.
Up to now I've been using an old copy of Microsoft Source Safe for source control but this isn't ideal for Android hence the ue of GitHub.
